  title: 'How stress sabotages clarity (3 simple steps)',
  goal: 'See what stress does to your mind and a simple first step to avoid heat‑of‑the‑moment decisions.',
  bullets: [
    'Under stress, the body goes into “alarm”: higher pulse, faster breathing, muscle tension.',
    'In “alarm”, attention narrows: you see more threat and fewer real options.',
    'Without a short physiological pause, decisions skew impulsive or overly defensive.',
  ],
  example:
    'You get a critical message and “boil” within seconds. The mind jumps to “not good enough” or “must reply now”. That’s the pattern of stress — not proof of weakness.',
  exercise: [
    'Pick a recent moment you felt lit up/tense.',
    'Write 1–2 lines: what you sensed in the body + the first thought that came.',
    'Add one alternative: “If I had 30s more, what else could I choose?”',
  ],
  linkToKuno:
    'As you answer Omni‑Kuno, notice where “alarm mode” shows most; train there first.',
