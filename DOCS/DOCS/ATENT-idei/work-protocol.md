Working protocol (Speed + Control):

North Star (single objective): <WRITE OBJECTIVE HERE>.

Rules:
1) No drift. Only changes that move the objective within 30–60 minutes.
2) Done = code change + command run + pasted output. No “CI later”, no “should work”.
3) Priority order: (1) determinism/test harness (e2e flags, gating, unique testids) → (2) minimal bug fix → (3) UX/refactor later.
4) If you suggest unrelated refactors/workflows/pages, I will reply “DRIFT” and we stop.

Deliver progress in this format only:
