# Flow Studio Exports

These files are one-off diagnostic snapshots exported from the Flow Studio admin tool (`/admin/flow-studio`). They are not canonical specs. Use them for inspections, recreating visual states, or sharing context externally.

Naming convention: `SNAPSHOT_<description>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`. Each snapshot mirrors the Flow Studio export schema at the time of capture. Do **not** treat these as source of truth—update the Flow Doc definitions in `DOCS/FLOW` or the console if you need canonical changes.
