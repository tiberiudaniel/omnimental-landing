# Daily Path Evolution — V1 (Canonical) → V2 (WOW)

## Context
Daily Path V1 was designed for structural clarity and consistency:
Intro → Learn → Quiz → Simulator → Real-World → Summary.

Daily Path V2 ("WOW") optimizes for psychological impact, memorability,
and immediate experiential change — without changing the underlying block schema.

This is an evolution of *intention and prioritization*, not a replacement.

## Structural Mapping (1:1)
V1 (Canonical):
Intro → Learn → Quiz → Simulator → Real-World → Summary

V2 (WOW):
Hook → Mirror → Core Insight → Active Check → Micro-Simulator → Real-World Transfer → Anchor Phrase → Close

### Mapping Table
| V1 Block | V2 Meaning | Practical Rule |
|---|---|---|
| INTRO | Hook + Mirror | Must disrupt an assumption + create recognition |
| LEARN | Core Insight | Must be ONE idea only (no mini-article) |
| QUIZ | Active Check | Must test discrimination, not memorization |
| SIMULATOR | Micro-Simulator (core) | Must be the center of gravity; must create a felt shift |
| REAL_WORLD / AUTONOMY | Transfer | One action for today, no lists |
| SUMMARY | Anchor Phrase (+ Close) | Must produce a repeatable one-liner |

## Key Principle
V2 does not introduce new blocks.
It redefines the intention and priority of existing blocks.

Shift:
V1 = information-first  
V2 = experience-first

## Compatibility Rule
All V1 modules remain valid.
WOW (V2) is a canonical orchestration layer applied to selected modules,
primarily the first user-facing experiences.

## Editorial Constraints (Non-negotiable)
- Deep default time budget: 7–9 minutes max
- LEARN: one idea only
- SIMULATOR: must be concrete, constrained, and slightly uncomfortable
- SUMMARY: must contain a single Anchor Phrase intended for long-term recall
