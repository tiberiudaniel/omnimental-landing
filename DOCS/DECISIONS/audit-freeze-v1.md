# Audit Freeze · V1

## 1. Categorization of Audit Items

### 🟢 Corect + Aplicabil Imediat
- Move CAT Lite Part 2, style profile, Stroop and other advanced steps until after real daily completions (timing fixes only).
- Add a single micro-reward + anticipation hook at the end of `/today/run`.
- Reveal radar/temple only after the first real daily session so the graphic = a tangible win.
- Gating screens must preview value and show countdown before unlock.
- Simplify over-dense cards and copy where debug/admin tone leaks into user flows.

### 🟡 Corect, dar Prematur / Depinde de Timing
- Full re-sequencing of onboarding into a brand-new 4-step experience (needs validated loop first).
- Redesign of CAT radar or telemetry UI beyond basic timing adjustments.
- Structural Observe→Try→Reflect learning loop (requires dedicated sprint and content changes).
- Identity-based commitments, sunk-cost loops, streak protectors (need data from improved session ending first).
- Visual design freeze / new brand system (wait until we know which flows survive V1).

### 🔴 Neaplicabil sau Interpretat Greșit
- Removing CAT Lite Part 1 entirely (we still need an initial self-scan signal).
- Pausing all telemetry/debug tooling (we still rely on it for diagnosing the above changes).
- Drastic terminology purge (Arc/Temple). We will control exposure, not delete concepts.

## 2. Decizii Non-Negociabile pentru V1
1. **Core loop first** – Every change in the next sprint must support the daily session finish (micro-reward + anticipation).
2. **Timing, not reinvention** – We only gate/move existing components; no new onboarding content or engines this cycle.
3. **No large refactors** – If a fix requires architecture or design-system upheaval, we defer and surface it explicitly.

## 3. Nu Implementăm în Următoarele 2 Săptămâni
- New onboarding script, videos, or cinematic rewrite.
- Arena/OmniKuno content changes, new drills, or pricing adjustments.
- Buddy/invite systems, referrals, or monetization experiments.
- Admin/telemetry redesign, dashboard polish, or new analytics.
- Any attempt to rewrite learning content into Observe→Try loops (not until the core loop test lands).
